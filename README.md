# Quick-Response-Assistant
I created Quick-Response-Assistant after realizing that a significant portion of my OpenAI usage involved refining responsesâ€”taking an email or message I received, drafting a reply, and then asking AI to polish it into a more professional, friendly, or appropriate tone. This tool streamlines that process with an intuitive interface.
