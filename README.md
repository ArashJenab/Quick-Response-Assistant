# Quick-Response-Assistant
I created Quick-Response-Assistant after realizing that a significant portion of my OpenAI usage involved refining responses—taking an email or message I received, drafting a reply, and then asking AI to polish it into a more professional, friendly, or appropriate tone. This tool streamlines that process with an intuitive interface.

# Note:
To use this tool, you'll need your own OpenAI API key saved as a plain text file named openai_api_key.txt in the same directory. The file should contain only the API key—no quotes or assignments ("" or =), just the key itself. This approach simplifies setup for all users.

# Features:
* Customizable Responses: Choose from multiple tones (professional, friendly, persuasive, etc.).
* Adaptable Styles: Craft responses in various communication styles (concise, diplomatic, engaging, etc.).
* Flexible Formats: Supports emails, text messages, and social media posts.
* User-Friendly GUI: Built with Tkinter, featuring input fields, AI-generated responses, and clipboard copy.
* Powered by OpenAI: Uses GPT models to refine responses instantly.
